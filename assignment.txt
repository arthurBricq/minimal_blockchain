As a reminder, the homework challenge will build up on the code you wrote during the first live technical interview.

Rules:

    You should spend at least 1 and at most 2 full days on it. We won’t be really strict about this; you can tell us on submission how long you spent and we will judge accordingly.
    You can submit your solution by email as a reply to this one. You can choose to put your code on a public GitHub repository but it’s not necessary.
    You can use any tools and libraries you want.

The homework:

Create a simulation of a PoW blockchain with multiple nodes. Each node should be able to:

    Receive transactions via API (for easy simulation) and add them to a pool of pending transactions (mempool).
    Broadcast transactions to the rest of the network nodes.
    Assemble them into blocks and mine these blocks, adding them to the local blockchain.
    Once a block is mined, it should be broadcast to the other nodes.
    Validate blocks received from other nodes and add them to the local copy of the blockchain.

Note 1: For the network interactions, you have the option to either mock the network environment or implement a more realistic networking solution.

Note 2: Running this simulation would also require a simple client (wallet) to send transactions to the nodes.

Note 3: A lot of details have been omitted on purpose. We expect you to decide how to fill the gaps.
